#+title: Week3 Notes

* Week 3 exercise notes

The Idea of the exercise was to use a training data to find the closest
neighbor for some test images. The method for training was 1NN.

** learning

First I implemented a very slow but easy to understand version of the problem.
I made a for loop that goes over all the test images and calculates the distance
to all of the training samples. at the same time I comapred the distaces to the
current min distance and updated the min distance accordingly.

*** Distance calculation

How I first calculated the distance was by using the numpy.linalg.norm method,
but this proved problematic.

Later after consulting chatgpt for the problem it said to calculate the distance
in smaller batches and using a different distance calculation method. The method
used a vectorized Euclidean distance.
